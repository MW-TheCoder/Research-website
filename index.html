            <td>In 1956 the dartmouth workshop started concieving AI 0 leading researchers including John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon and Nathaniel Rochester gathered at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire to establish scope, challenges and approaches in mechanizing intelligence.</td>
            <td>From 1974 to 1980, AI funding declined drastically, making this time known as the First AI Winter. The term AI winter was explicitly referencing nuclear winters, a name used to describe the aftermath of a nuclear attack when no one can live in the area due to the high radiation. </td>
            <td>The 2010s were marked by a surge in deep learning (DL) and the availability of huge amounts of data. DL, a type of ML, enabled AI systems to learn from massive datasets and make more accurate predictions. The rise of deep learning:Enabled AI systems to analyze images, speech, and text with high accuracy Revolutionized areas like self-driving cars, natural language processing, and computer vision Paved the way for the development of cognitive architectures, which can process and reason about complex information</td>
            <td>Artificial intelligence’s (AI) influence on society has never been more pronounced. Since ChatGPT became a ubiquitous feature on computer desktops in late 2022, the rapid development and deployment of generative AI and large language model (LLM) tools have started to transform industries and show the potential to touch many aspects of modern life. AI has even surpassed human-level performance on several benchmark tasks and is succeeding in helping workers become more productive and produce better-quality work. That’s according to Stanford University’s AI Index report.</td>
